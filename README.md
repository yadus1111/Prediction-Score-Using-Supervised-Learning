## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can estimate a student's score based on the number of hours they study. We used a linear regression model to establish the relationship between study hours and scores.

## Dataset

## Results

The project includes data visualization, model training, prediction, and evaluation. Here are some key results:

- The linear regression model predicts student scores based on study hours.
- The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used to evaluate the model's performance.
- A scatter plot visualizes the actual vs. predicted scores.

  
### We made predictions using the trained model, including predicting the score for a specific case where a student studies for 9.25 hours, which resulted in a predicted score of approximately 92.39.Â¶
